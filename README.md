This repository follows the [Google Machine Learning Crash Course: Linear Regression](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/linear-regression).

## Overview

Linear regression is a statistical technique used to determine the relationship between variables. In the context of machine learning, linear regression models the relationship between input features and a target label.

- **Training**: The process of determining a model's optimal weights and bias by minimizing the loss function. During training, both the weights and bias are updated to reduce prediction errors.
- **Inference**: Using the learned weights and bias to make predictions on new, unseen data.
